# MicroVerse
MicroVerse - Splines

This package requires MicroVerse to be installed.

This package also relies on the Unity Spline Tool, which is currently in beta and set to be released for Unity 2022.3. However, a version I backported for Unity 2021 is included with this package. 

To install, unzip the UnitySplinesFor2021 file somewhere outside of your project. Then open the package manager from Windows/PackageManager and click the small + in the top left corner of the window and select "Add Package from Disk". Navigate to the package.json file in the unzipped folder and select it. This will add the splines package to your project. 

Note that when upgrading to 2022, this dependency should be removed in favor of the official spline package.
