# Join knots

Join knots to connect the ends of two splines to each other. 

When you join two knots, they collapse to the same position and become a single knot. The new, joined knot takes the position of the active knot. The active knot is the last knot you selected. To join knots, both knots must each have only one segment. 

If you join the knots of two splines that flow<!--add link to flow documentation--> in different directions, the new spline takes the direction of the active knot. 

To join knots:
1. In the [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) or [Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html), select a spline.
1. In the Tools overlay, set the tool context to **Spline**.
1. Select two knots that have only one segment each. 
1. In the Element Inspector overlay, select **Join**.
